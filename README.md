simple patreon mirror for personal use

mainly created since I hate using patreon to navigate WN content

### warning

vibe coded because i just want to read stuff from what I subscribe in patreon.

although i personally work on the dynamic content parsing + SQLite caching myself because
using nuxt/content is too limited for my needs.

since i want the server to keep running while I pull new content and then dynamically render the content on demand.
